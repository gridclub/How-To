Suppose you have a new event for which you need a sign-up form, e.g. a hackathon.


## MailChimp: create a new list
+ Login to your MailChimp account
+ Go to the "Lists" page
+ Create "New List"
+ Put in the lists details, using "GRiD" and the "grid-officers" as name and email
+ Save

## Sign-up form
Now we are ready to have a signup form plug-in on our event website.

+ In the "Lists" page, click the drop-down menu next to your new list's name
+ Select "Embeddable forms" on the drop-down menu options
+ This will give a bare-bones sign-up with an embeddable HTML snippet
+ Further customization can be done in "Form Builder"
