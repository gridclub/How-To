At the time of this writing, the usual places one can hold for events in the math department are:

1. Room 1528, 15th floor,
2. Room 1530, 15th floor, 
3. and Room 1634, 16th floor. 

Capacity-wise, option 3 is the best. Option 1 and 2 can be used when attendance is expected to be 
low or for officer meetings. **To book the rooms**, it is preferable that a math department student 
sends an e-mail to the Assistant of the Chair of the Math department. The e-mail should contain the 
number of the room, the reason for the meeting, and the timeframe. 

**Beware:** Regular seminars in the department take priority over anything else, even if they appear 
to be cancelled. Always check the departmental calendar and have alternatives, just in case.
